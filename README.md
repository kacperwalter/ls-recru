## TL;DR;
I prefer pair programming for assessing developer skills over time-consuming recruitment tasks. This project is my response to a most typical recruitment task, showcasing my Frontend skills.

## What's going on with that repo
To be honest with you, **I am a strong advocate for pair programming sessions as a more effective way to assess developer skills, as opposed to time-consuming and often unproductive recruitment tasks.** Having completed numerous recru tasks throughout my career, I've learned valuable lessons from some, while many ended up being a significant time sink without even minimal feedback.  
  
In this repo, I meet your expectations and aim to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in software engineering by presenting a solution to a typical recruitment task. Given the task of creating multiple pages, fetching data from an API, and making the application dynamic, **this project reflects my current software development capabilities when given a few days to complete a task.**

## I am pretty good at layouts and CSS
But not here. This project focused on delivering logic, not fancy styling. For fancy styling look for [Netguru website](https://www.netguru.com/) - that's the best showcase of my CSS (Sass) abilities. 

## What I could improve in this solution
There are always things to do better or improve. It's the same with this project - list of these things is in [Issues](https://github.com/kacperwalter/typical-recru-project/issues) tab.
